# BeyondTrust Professional Services Pre-Check toolkit

BeyondTrust Professional / Implementation Services (ProServe) may sometimes 
request customers run certain scripts to gather information about the customer 
environment for project scoping, analysis, or product deployment purposes. 
Many customers ask about the required uses of these scripts, so this document 
will attempt to answer those questions.

# Script Overview

There are 2 scripts in scope for this discussion – pbis-pre-check.sh and 
ad-info.vbs.  They are available directly from BeyondTrust in a single zip 
file in the Releases section of this site.

## pbis-pre-check.sh

This script needs to be run on a representative set of UNIX systems.  It will 
provide a series of compatibility checks for the BeyondTrust software and 
better allow our Professional Services team the ability to plan for your 
environment. 

The script should normally be run with no parameters. However, should there be 
any environmental or security concerns, the `--help` switch will display 
options to filter out the various tests and data collection options.  These 
options should be made to match your security/management restrictions on 
data/information sharing with us.  For example, the script can skip running 
processes and skip internet connectivity tests when run with the 
`--no_ps --no_internet` parameters. Professional Services recommends including 
all tests (i.e. no parameters).  We specifically request that whenever possible
you do not choose the `--no_lug` (no local user/group information) as we 
require this information to audit your current accounts and prepare them for 
migration with your other directory services.  

Because account remediation is a major task in the deployment process, it is 
highly recommended that the script is run on all boxes which have local 
user/group accounts.  Since most systems have local accounts that are often in 
conflict with other systems or directory services, the more information we 
have, the better we can help in consolidating and migrating to Active 
Directory.

The script should not need root execution unless file permissions have been 
restricted.

For each system, a `hostname-pbis-health-check.srf` file will be created 
in `/tmp`.  

## ad-info.vbs

This script should be run on a Windows workstation joined to the same forest 
that will authenticate and authorize PBIS clients.  If multiple forests are 
involved, then it should be run on each.  The script needs at least Domain 
User privileges to collect all information.  If possible, the script should be 
run in the Forest Root.

ad-info.vbs is run from a command prompt as follows:

`cscript ad-info.vbs > %userdnsdomain%-ad-info.out`

NOTE: If you have never run VB scripts on the host box, you may need to set up 
console output to be captured using the following: 

`cscript //h:cscript //s`

##Active Directory Information

###Active Directory Map

Multi-tree forests create additional requirements for Single-Sign-On and DNS setup to properly enumerate from UNIX hosts.  Additionally, the Schema Master in a multi-forest setup may not be in the same domain as the Cell will be created.

###Forest Info

PBIS Directory Integrated Mode only works on forests at Windows 2003 Forest Level or higher.

###RFC2307 Attributes

Determines the work required to move to Directory Integrated Mode, or discover issues before running the DI wizard.

###Domain List

List all domains and their NT4 and FQDN names. Used for Disjointed DNS discovery or DNS/NT4 name mismatches.

###Trust List

One-way trusts are only supported by PBIS Named Cells. Non-transitive two-way trusts can create troubleshooting difficulties with the PBIS Default Cell.

###PBIS Cells

List of existing PBIS Cells, used to identify servers to identity maps.
If no cell is found, but Likewise Open clients exist, care must be taken to not break those clients when creating the cell (Likewise Open can operate in Cell mode, but PBIS Open cannot).

###Active Directory Sites and Subnets

Map Unix system IP addresses to the Active Directory Site they will be joined to.

###DCs by Site

Helps PBIS team determine if any sites might need more Domain Controller / Global Catalog coverage when UNIX systems are joined to  their default sites.
